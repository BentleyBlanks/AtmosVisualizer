 - Raspberry Pi 1 and 2

See [Releases](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui/releases/) for previous versions.

#### Upgrade Notes
The latest version uses the keyword `ofxImGui` as a namespace for all classes in the addon, while previous versions just had a class called `ofxImGui`. If you're upgrading from a previous version, make sure to replace all instances of class `ofxImGui` with `ofxImGui::Gui`.
